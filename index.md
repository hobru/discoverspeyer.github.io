Individual City Tours through Speyer: Whether it's the Cathedral, the Jewish Courtyard, or the Trinity Church, Speyer has a lot to offer. On a short walk, you can discover not only two UNESCO World Heritage Sites but also learn a great deal about Speyer's 2,000-year history.

My name is Holger Bruchelt, and I am an official city guide in Speyer. I studied physics and continue to be amazed by the achievements of the builders of the cathedral nearly 1,000 years ago.

I would be delighted to show you some highlights of my beautiful city during a tour of about two hours and to share my enthusiasm with you.
