## Discover and Remember Speyer
Whether it's the Cathedral, the Jewish Courtyard, the Trinity Church or the [Technikmusem](/Technikmuseum/), [Speyer](/Speyer/) has a lot to offer. . On a short walk, you can discover not only two UNESCO World Heritage Sites but also learn a great deal about Speyer's 2,000-year history.

My name is Holger Bruchelt, and I am an official city guide in Speyer. I studied physics and continue to be amazed by the achievements of the builders of the cathedral nearly 1,000 years ago.

I would be delighted to show you some highlights of my beautiful city during a tour  and to share my enthusiasm with you.
